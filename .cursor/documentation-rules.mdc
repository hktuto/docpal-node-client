# Documentation Location Rules - MANDATORY

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULE: Documentation Location Policy

### ALL Documentation Must Be in `apps/docs/` Package

**This is a MANDATORY requirement with NO exceptions:**

- ✅ **Correct Location**: `apps/docs/content/`
- ❌ **NEVER Place Documentation In**: 
  - `apps/web/` (web application)
  - `libraries/` (shared libraries)  
  - `packages/` (shared packages)
  - Root directory
  - Any other location

### Documentation Structure

```
apps/docs/content/
├── index.md                    # Main documentation index
├── getting-started.md          # General getting started
├── authentication.md           # General auth docs
├── event-bus.md               # General event bus docs
├── server-health.md           # General health check docs
└── 6.0.0/                     # Version-specific docs
    ├── getting-started.md      # Version-specific setup
    ├── authentication.md       # Version-specific auth
    ├── event-bus.md           # Version-specific events
    └── server-health.md       # Version-specific health
```

### What Constitutes "Documentation"

- API documentation and guides
- User guides and tutorials
- System architecture documentation
- Feature implementation guides
- Code examples and snippets
- Setup and installation guides
- Troubleshooting guides
- Best practices documentation
- Change logs and release notes
- Developer onboarding materials

### Exception: Code Comments

The ONLY exception to this rule is:
- JSDoc comments within code files
- Inline code comments for business logic
- README.md files for individual packages (package-specific setup only)

### Enforcement

- **Code Reviews**: Reject any PR that places documentation outside `apps/docs/`
- **AI Assistants**: Always move documentation to correct location
- **Development**: Check documentation location before any commit
- **Migration**: Move existing documentation from incorrect locations

### Why This Rule Exists

1. **Centralized Management**: All documentation in one place
2. **Consistent Structure**: Predictable location for all docs
3. **Version Control**: Proper versioning of documentation
4. **Easy Maintenance**: Single source of truth
5. **User Experience**: Clear navigation and discoverability

## Quick Checklist

Before creating or moving documentation:

- [ ] Is this going in `apps/docs/content/`?
- [ ] Is the version folder correct (check `apps/web/package.json`)?
- [ ] Are internal links using versioned paths?
- [ ] Is the main index updated with new content?
- [ ] Have I removed any documentation from incorrect locations?

**Remember**: This rule is NON-NEGOTIABLE. All documentation belongs in `apps/docs/`.
